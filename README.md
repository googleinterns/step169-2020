### Objective
With The Hub, we hope to organize information from both local and international news sources and present them in the visually appealing format of a map. We hope that by showing a multitude of sources and perspectives for many different local topics, users will be able to develop a more informed opinion on local events. On a global scale, we hope to increase user’s awareness of geography’s effect on current events.
